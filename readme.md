## About Recruit Me App

This app only for personal use. During my life i was faced with messed process of hiring. All conversation with HR'ses were conducted mostly aparted via mailing, chatting what caused to applying and sending my cv randomly, made it hard to remember where cv was sent and above all to track does there was response from HR or no.
